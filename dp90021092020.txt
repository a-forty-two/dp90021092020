

Hello World!
We'll get started shortly once audience arrives!
(latest by IST 6:40 PM or PST 6:10 AM)
- Relational
- Warehouse



EL: Your data is ready for analysis!

ELT: Extract-load into cloud-keep transforming!!!

ETL: Extract-Transform-Load

SMALL Data-> OLTP (Source of data)-> backend for web
Big Data-> OLAP (target of data)-> Viz, Dashboards

Big Data: Volume, Velocity, Variety 

BLOB-> binary large object
	-> File, images, videos, audio, csv
	-> Block (everything), Page (disk images), Append (small)

DataLake: enterprise analytical storage
Blob Storage: massive cheap storage
	(temp sotrage- not optimized
	for analytics)


Heirarchial namespaces:
	POINTER MANIPULATION for folder structure
	Helps access data faster and neatly arranged
User Principals: username password
Service Principals: certificates, SAS, keys 


SHARED ACCESS SIGNATURE: time bound, permission bound
	-> IP bound (optional)
	-> Anonymous 

RBAC-> Azure Active Directory

Labs: 10mins

AI, Data Sciences, Data Engineers 
- IaaS or PaaS 

IaaS-> manage this infra for you and you have control on configuration
PaaS-> Azure does everything-> you manage performance and cost 

SCALABILITY is why to USE CLOUD! 
Favs automation: Python, Go, Scala, C#, Java... 
Pipelines: Apache Beam-> Py/Java 
Flow-> DataFlow, Tensorflow-> Directed Acylic Graph!

-> CosmosDB:
	- Highly available and GEO-dist data 
	- bills you PER collection/database 
	- every table/collection's performance is separate
	- ALWAYS on 
	- Consistency levels: balance b/w availability and 
		performance -> performance + availability = 1
	- 2 backups every 4 hours!
	- accidentally deleted tables/collc. can be retrvd. 
		upto 8 hours!!!
	
Managed Services- VM but managed by Azure!!! 
	- Failovers-> Automatic! 

TLS-> Transport Layer Security 


Serverless- no infra! no VM!
AI100, DP200, DP201, Dp100
Security:
	- data at rest: TDE
	- data in motion/transit: TLS (min. version) 
	- Firewall: Server Firewall, Database Firewall 

total isolation from internet-> Virtual machines in an isolated n/w

HDInsight-> Spark, Hadoop, Kafka, Storm, ML with R, Interactive Query (HIVE on Hadoop), Hbase (no-sql dw)
Customer managed Key- encryption will be done by YOUR
	key rather than Az! Fin, Sec, Govt...

Microsoft Managed key- general purpose 

KeyVault: service to distribute secrets, certificates
	- NO PASSWORDS! 
	- Hardware security modules can be used
